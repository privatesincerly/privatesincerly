## 🔊 My favorite songs (categorized, of course.)

###### DISCLAIMER: I may not be updating this list anytime there's a new song I like. If you want to know all my favorite songs in real time, I suggest you take a look at my [stats.fm](http://stats.fm/privatesincerly) page and look for songs that I play a lot of times (like, REALLY a lot) from the current year.

##### Honorable mentions:
