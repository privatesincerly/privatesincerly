### Who am I?

I’m a student based in 🇫🇷 France, with a strong interest in mathematics and computer science/programming. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, whether that’s solving logical problems or exploring how software is built from simple ideas.

Most of my time is spent experimenting with small projects. I like trying things out, breaking them, and learning from the process. Right now, I’m focused on building a solid foundation rather than chasing big or flashy projects. I’m still figuring out what I want to specialize in, but I like keeping things minimal, curious, and practical for the moment.

Outside of programming, [music](https://stats.fm/privatesincerly) plays a big role in my life. I’ve listened to around 1,900+ albums so far, and my favorite artist is Tate McRae. You can find some of my all-time [favorite songs](FAVORITE_SONGS.md) in my self-titled repository.
